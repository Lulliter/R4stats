  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Cardiovascular diseases kill approximately 17 million people globally every year, and they mainly exhibit as myocardial infarctions and heart failures. Heart failure (HF) occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body.Available electronic medical records of patients quantify symptoms, body features, and clinical laboratory test values, which can be used to perform biostatistics analysis aimed at highlighting patterns and correlations otherwise undetectable by medical doctors. Machine learning, in particular, can predict patients' survival from their data and can individuate the most important features among those included in their medical records.                                         Methods               In this paper, we analyze a dataset of 299 patients with heart failure collected in 2015. We apply several machine learning classifiers to both predict the patients survival, and rank the features corresponding to the most important risk factors. We also perform an alternative feature ranking analysis by employing traditional biostatistics tests, and compare these results with those provided by the machine learning algorithms. Since both feature ranking approaches clearly identify serum creatinine and ejection fraction as the two most relevant features, we then build the machine learning survival prediction models on these two factors alone.                                         Results               Our results of these two-feature models show not only that serum creatinine and ejection fraction are sufficient to predict survival of heart failure patients from medical records, but also that using these two features alone can lead to more accurate predictions than using the original dataset features in its entirety. We also carry out an analysis including the follow-up month of each patient: even in this case, serum creatinine and ejection fraction are the most predictive clinical features of the dataset, and are sufficient to predict patients' survival.                                         Conclusions               This discovery has the potential to impact on clinical practice, becoming a new supporting tool for physicians when predicting if a heart failure patient will survive or not. Indeed, medical doctors aiming at understanding if a patient will survive after heart failure may focus mainly on serum creatinine and ejection fraction.},

  abstract = {Background:~Platelets are important mediators of coagulation, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. We conducted a large population study with National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to understand the relationship of total platelet count (TPC) with health and disease in humans. Methods:~NHANES is a cross-sectional survey of non-institutionalized United States adults, administered every 2 years by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Participants answer a questionnaire, receive a physical examination, and undergo laboratory tests. TPC values were analyzed for a six-year period of NHANES (2011--2016). Weighted 10th~and 90th~percentiles were calculated, and logistic regression was used to predict likelihood (Odds ratio [OR]) of being in categories with TPC {$<$} 10th~percentile or {$>$} 90th~percentile. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata/SE 15.1, using population weights for complex survey design. Results:~The mean TPC for our sample (N = 17,969) was 236 \texttimes{} 103/\textmu L (SD = 59 \texttimes{} 103) with the 10th~percentile 170 \texttimes{} 103/\textmu L and the 90th~percentile 311 \texttimes{} 103/\textmu L. Hispanics (other than Mexican Americans) and obese individuals had lower odds of a TPC {$<$} 10th~percentile. Males, Blacks, adults aged {$\geq$} 45 years, and those with a recent (last 12 months) hospital stay were more likely to have a TPC {$<$} 10th~percentile. Obese individuals and Mexican Americans had higher odds of having TPC {$>$} 90th~percentile. Individuals with a congestive heart failure (CHF) or coronary heart disease (CHD) diagnosis had over twice the odds (OR 2.06, 95\% CI: 1.50-2.82, p ={$<$} 0.001, and 2.11, 95\% CI: 1.48-3.01, p ={$<$} 0.001, respectively) of having TPC {$<$}10th~percentile. Individuals with an emphysema or asthma diagnosis were more likely to have TPC {$>$} 90th~percentile (OR 1.84, 95\% CI: 1.08-3.13, p = 0.026, and 1.25, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.56, p = 0.046, respectively). A diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer did not have significant associations with TPC. Conclusions:~Our study showed that obese individuals are more likely to have higher TPC. Individuals with CHF and CHD had higher odds of having TPC {$<$} 10th~percentile, and those with emphysema and asthma were more likely to have TPC {$>$} 90th~percentile.

In many disciplines there is near-exclusive use of statistical modeling for causal explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power are inherently of high predictive power. Conflation between explanation and prediction is common, yet the distinction must be understood for progressing scientific knowledge. While this distinction has been recognized in the philosophy of science, the statistical literature lacks a thorough discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for an explanatory versus a predictive goal. The purpose of this article is to clarify the distinction between explanatory and predictive modeling, to discuss its sources, and to reveal the practical implications of the distinction to each step in the modeling process.},

One might ask: does screen time influence childhood obesity? Could overuse of paracetamol in infancy cause wheeze? How does breastfeeding affect later cognitive outcomes? In this review, we present causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to a paediatric audience. DAGs are a graphical tool which provide a way to visually represent and better understand the key concepts of exposure, outcome, causation, confounding, and bias. We use clinical examples, including those outlined above, framed in the language of DAGs, to demonstrate their potential applications. We show how DAGs can be most useful in identifying confounding and sources of bias, demonstrating inappropriate statistical adjustments for presumed biases, and understanding threats to validity in randomised controlled trials. We believe that a familiarity with DAGs, and the concepts underlying them, will be of benefit both to the researchers planning studies, and~practising clinicians interpreting them.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose---               Cognitive decline occurs earlier than previously realized and is already evident at the age of 45. Because cardiovascular risk factors are established risk factors for cognitive decline in old age, we investigated whether cardiovascular risk factors are also associated with cognitive decline in young and middle-aged groups.                                         Methods---               The cross-sectional study included 3778 participants aged 35 to 82 years (mean age, 54 years) and free of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Cognitive function was measured with the Ruff Figural Fluency Test (RFFT; worst score, 0; best score, 175 points) and the Visual Association Test (VAT; worst score, 0; best score, 12 points). Overall cardiovascular risk was assessed with the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) for general cardiovascular disease (best score, -5; worst score, 33 points).                                         Results---                                Mean RFFT score (SD) was 70 (26) points, median VAT score (interquartile range) was 10 (9--11) points, and mean FRS (SD) was 10 (6) points. Using linear regression analysis adjusting for educational level, RFFT was negatively associated with FRS. RFFT score decreased by 1.54 points (95\% confidence interval, -1.66 to -1.44;                 P                 {$<$}0.001) per point increase in FRS. This negative association was not only limited to older age groups, but also found in the young (35--44 years). The main influencing components of the FRS were age (                 P                 {$<$}0.001), diabetes mellitus (                 P                 =0.001), and smoking (                 P                 {$<$}0.001). Similar results were found for VAT score as outcome measure.                                                        Conclusions---               In this large population--based cohort, a worse overall cardiovascular risk profile was associated with poorer cognitive function. This association was already present in young adults aged 35 to 44 years.},

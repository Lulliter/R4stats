  abstract = {Difference-in-differences analysis with staggered treatment timing is frequently used to assess the impact of policy changes on corporate outcomes in academic research. However, recent advances in econometric theory show that such designs are likely to be biased in the presence of treatment effect heterogeneity. Given the pronounced use of staggered treatment designs in applied corporate finance and accounting research, this finding potentially impacts a large swath of prior findings in these fields. We survey the nascent literature and document how and when such bias arises from treatment effect heterogeneity. We apply recently proposed methods to a set of prior published results, and find that correcting for the bias induced by the staggered nature of policy adoption frequently impacts the estimated effect from standard difference-indifference studies. In many cases, the reported effects in prior research become indistinguishable from zero.},

  abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 disease) uses the Spike proteins of its envelope for infecting target cells expressing on the membrane the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enzyme that acts as a receptor. To control the pandemic, genetically engineered vaccines have been designed for inducing neutralizing antibodies against the Spike proteins. These vaccines do not act like traditional protein-based vaccines, as they deliver the message in the form of mRNA or DNA to host cells that then produce and expose the Spike protein on the membrane (from which it can be shed in soluble form) to alert the immune system. Mass vaccination has brought to light various adverse effects associated with these genetically based vaccines, mainly affecting the circulatory and cardiovascular system. ACE2 is present as membrane-bound on several cell types, including the mucosa of the upper respiratory and of the gastrointestinal tracts, the endothelium, the platelets, and in soluble form in the plasma. The ACE2 enzyme converts the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II into peptides with vasodilator properties. Here we review the pathways for immunization and the molecular mechanisms through which the Spike protein, either from SARS-CoV-2 or encoded by the mRNA-based vaccines, interferes with the Renin-Angiotensin-System governed by ACE2, thus altering the homeostasis of the circulation and of the cardiovascular system. Understanding the molecular interactions of the Spike protein with ACE2 and the consequent impact on cardiovascular system homeostasis will direct the diagnosis and therapy of the vaccine-related adverse effects and provide information for development of a personalized vaccination that considers pathophysiological conditions predisposing to such adverse events.},

Well planned population-based studies, however, are necessary to evaluate the overall effectiveness of vaccination programmes. A study carried out in the province of Pescara is used to illustrate the potential biases that may affect such studies. The Pescara study analysed total and non-COVID-19 mortality and the occurrence of Potentially Vaccine-Related Serious Adverse Events (PVRSAEs) in vaccinated and unvaccinated people, from January 2021, when vaccines became available, to July 2022. The study reported a lower probability of both total and non-COVID-19 death in vaccinated people. However, the authors did not include in the denominator of the unvaccinated cohort the population experience of the vaccinated cohort before vaccination (immortal time bias). Correcting the denominator of the unvaccinated cohort, the crude death rate of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons becomes the same. For the same reason, the unvaccinated non-COVID-19 mortality was overestimated, as was the mortality of people receiving only one or two vaccine doses. Confounding by indication and the healthy vaccinee bias will also be discussed, as well as the bias deriving by not considering the evolution of risk over time.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Cardiovascular diseases kill approximately 17 million people globally every year, and they mainly exhibit as myocardial infarctions and heart failures. Heart failure (HF) occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body.Available electronic medical records of patients quantify symptoms, body features, and clinical laboratory test values, which can be used to perform biostatistics analysis aimed at highlighting patterns and correlations otherwise undetectable by medical doctors. Machine learning, in particular, can predict patients' survival from their data and can individuate the most important features among those included in their medical records.                                         Methods               In this paper, we analyze a dataset of 299 patients with heart failure collected in 2015. We apply several machine learning classifiers to both predict the patients survival, and rank the features corresponding to the most important risk factors. We also perform an alternative feature ranking analysis by employing traditional biostatistics tests, and compare these results with those provided by the machine learning algorithms. Since both feature ranking approaches clearly identify serum creatinine and ejection fraction as the two most relevant features, we then build the machine learning survival prediction models on these two factors alone.                                         Results               Our results of these two-feature models show not only that serum creatinine and ejection fraction are sufficient to predict survival of heart failure patients from medical records, but also that using these two features alone can lead to more accurate predictions than using the original dataset features in its entirety. We also carry out an analysis including the follow-up month of each patient: even in this case, serum creatinine and ejection fraction are the most predictive clinical features of the dataset, and are sufficient to predict patients' survival.                                         Conclusions               This discovery has the potential to impact on clinical practice, becoming a new supporting tool for physicians when predicting if a heart failure patient will survive or not. Indeed, medical doctors aiming at understanding if a patient will survive after heart failure may focus mainly on serum creatinine and ejection fraction.},

R can be defined as an environment for statistical analysis and at the same time a language and a software. It is a very powerful and widely used open source tool for statistical analysis of data, moreover, being a real programming language, it contains the potential to independently create and develop various applications useful for manipulation, management and analysis of any type of data. In fact, its main features include simplicity in data management and manipulation, the availability of a suite of tools for calculations on vectors, matrices and other complex operations, access to a vast set of integrated tools and functions developed by others and made available for statistical analysis, the production of numerous particularly flexible graphic potentials, the possibility of using a real object-oriented programming language that allows the use of conditional and cyclic structures, as well as functions created by the user. Offering an elaborate introduction to programming with R, this course aims to intercept the needs of the participants by focusing in particular on some fundamental aspects such as data manipulation and management, their analysis through the identification of the most appropriate statistical test and the visualization of data and results using the graphic potential made available by R. The course involves the use of numerous "datasets" and examples that may be familiar to the various areas of interest in order to facilitate participants in understanding and applying the knowledge acquired.},

  abstract = {The second edition of the Impact Evaluation in Practice handbook is a comprehensive and accessible introduction to impact evaluation for policy makers and development practitioners. First published in 2011, it has been used widely across the development and academic communities. The book incorporates real-world examples to present practical guidelines for designing and implementing impact evaluations. Readers will gain an understanding of impact evaluations and the best ways to use them to design evidence-based policies and programs. The updated version covers the newest techniques for evaluating programs and includes state-of-the-art implementation advice, as well as an expanded set of examples and case studies that draw on recent development challenges. It also includes new material on research ethics and partnerships to conduct impact evaluation. The handbook is divided into four sections: Part One discusses what to evaluate and why; Part Two presents the main impact evaluation methods; Part Three addresses how to manage impact evaluations; Part Four reviews impact evaluation sampling and data collection. Case studies illustrate different applications of impact evaluations. The book links to complementary instructional material available online, including an applied case as well as questions and answers. The updated second edition will be a valuable resource for the international development community, universities, and policy makers looking to build better evidence around what works in development},

  abstract = {Matching and weighting methods for observational studies involve the choice of an estimand, the causal effect with reference to a specific target population. Commonly used estimands include the average treatment effect in the treated (ATT), the average treatment effect in the untreated (ATU), the average treatment effect in the population (ATE), and the average treatment effect in the overlap (i.e., equipoise population; ATO). Each estimand has its own assumptions, interpretation, and statistical methods that can be used to estimate it. This article provides guidance on selecting and interpreting an estimand to help medical researchers correctly implement statistical methods used to estimate causal effects in observational studies and to help audiences correctly interpret the results and limitations of these studies. The interpretations of the estimands resulting from regression and instrumental variable analyses are also discussed. Choosing an estimand carefully is essential for making valid inferences from the analysis of observational data and ensuring results are replicable and useful for practitioners.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose---               Cognitive decline occurs earlier than previously realized and is already evident at the age of 45. Because cardiovascular risk factors are established risk factors for cognitive decline in old age, we investigated whether cardiovascular risk factors are also associated with cognitive decline in young and middle-aged groups.                                         Methods---               The cross-sectional study included 3778 participants aged 35 to 82 years (mean age, 54 years) and free of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Cognitive function was measured with the Ruff Figural Fluency Test (RFFT; worst score, 0; best score, 175 points) and the Visual Association Test (VAT; worst score, 0; best score, 12 points). Overall cardiovascular risk was assessed with the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) for general cardiovascular disease (best score, -5; worst score, 33 points).                                         Results---                                Mean RFFT score (SD) was 70 (26) points, median VAT score (interquartile range) was 10 (9--11) points, and mean FRS (SD) was 10 (6) points. Using linear regression analysis adjusting for educational level, RFFT was negatively associated with FRS. RFFT score decreased by 1.54 points (95\% confidence interval, -1.66 to -1.44;                 P                 {$<$}0.001) per point increase in FRS. This negative association was not only limited to older age groups, but also found in the young (35--44 years). The main influencing components of the FRS were age (                 P                 {$<$}0.001), diabetes mellitus (                 P                 =0.001), and smoking (                 P                 {$<$}0.001). Similar results were found for VAT score as outcome measure.                                                        Conclusions---               In this large population--based cohort, a worse overall cardiovascular risk profile was associated with poorer cognitive function. This association was already present in young adults aged 35 to 44 years.},

  abstract = {A goal of many research programmes in biology is to extract meaningful insights from large, complex datasets. Researchers in ecology, evolution and behavior (EEB) often grapple with long-term, observational datasets from which they construct models to test causal hypotheses about biological processes. Similarly, epidemiologists analyse large, complex observational datasets to understand the distribution and determinants of human health. A key difference in the analytical workflows for these two distinct areas of biology is the delineation of data analysis tasks and explicit use of causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), widely adopted by epidemiologists. Here, we review the most recent causal inference literature and describe an analytical workflow that has direct applications for EEB. We start this commentary by defining four distinct analytical tasks (description, prediction, association, causal inference). The remainder of the text is dedicated to causal inference, specifically focusing on the use of DAGs to inform the modelling strategy. Given the increasing interest in causal inference and misperceptions regarding this task, we seek to facilitate an exchange of ideas between disciplinary silos and provide an analytical framework that is particularly relevant for making causal inference from observational data.},

  abstract = {Statistical modeling is a powerful tool for developing and testing theories by way of causal explanation, prediction, and description. In many disciplines there is near-exclusive use of statistical modeling for causal explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power are inherently of high predictive power. Conflation between explanation and prediction is common, yet the distinction must be understood for progressing scientific knowledge. While this distinction has been recognized in the philosophy of science, the statistical literature lacks a thorough discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for an explanatory versus a predictive goal. The purpose of this article is to clarify the distinction between explanatory and predictive modeling, to discuss its sources, and to reveal the practical implications of the distinction to each step in the modeling process.},

One might ask: does screen time influence childhood obesity? Could overuse of paracetamol in infancy cause wheeze? How does breastfeeding affect later cognitive outcomes? In this review, we present causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to a paediatric audience. DAGs are a graphical tool which provide a way to visually represent and better understand the key concepts of exposure, outcome, causation, confounding, and bias. We use clinical examples, including those outlined above, framed in the language of DAGs, to demonstrate their potential applications. We show how DAGs can be most useful in identifying confounding and sources of bias, demonstrating inappropriate statistical adjustments for presumed biases, and understanding threats to validity in randomised controlled trials. We believe that a familiarity with DAGs, and the concepts underlying them, will be of benefit both to the researchers planning studies, and~practising clinicians interpreting them.},

  abstract = {Background: Platelets are important mediators of coagulation, inflammation, andatherosclerosis. We conducted a large population study with National Health and NutritionExamination Survey (NHANES) data to understand the relationship of total platelet count(TPC) with health and disease in humans.Methods: NHANES is a cross-sectional survey of non-institutionalized United States adults,administered every 2 years by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Participantsanswer a questionnaire, receive a physical examination, and undergo laboratory tests. TPCvalues were analyzed for a six-year period of NHANES (2011--2016). Weighted 10th and 90thpercentiles were calculated, and logistic regression was used to predict likelihood (Odds ratio[OR]) of being in categories with TPC {$<$} 10th percentile or {$>$} 90th percentile. Statistical analysiswas performed using Stata/SE 15.1, using population weights for complex survey design.Results: The mean TPC for our sample (N = 17,969) was 236 \texttimes{} 103/{$\mu$}L (SD = 59 \texttimes{} 103)with the 10th percentile 170 \texttimes{} 103/{$\mu$}L and the 90th percentile 311 \texttimes{} 103/{$\mu$}L. Hispanics (otherthan Mexican Americans) and obese individuals had lower odds of a TPC {$<$} 10th percentile.Males, Blacks, adults aged {$\geq$} 45 years, and those with a recent (last 12 months) hospital staywere more likely to have a TPC {$<$} 10th percentile. Obese individuals and Mexican Americanshad higher odds of having TPC {$>$} 90th percentile. Individuals with a congestive heart failure(CHF) or coronary heart disease (CHD) diagnosis had over twice the odds (OR 2.06, 95\% CI:1.50-2.82, p ={$<$} 0.001, and 2.11, 95\% CI: 1.48-3.01, p ={$<$} 0.001, respectively) of having TPC{$<$}10th percentile. Individuals with an emphysema or asthma diagnosis were more likely to haveTPC {$>$} 90th percentile (OR 1.84, 95\% CI: 1.08-3.13, p = 0.026, and 1.25, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.56,p = 0.046, respectively). A diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer didnot have significant associations with TPC.Conclusions: Our study showed that obese individuals are more likely to havehigher TPC. Individuals with CHF and CHD had higher odds of having TPC {$<$} 10thpercentile, and those with emphysema and asthma were more likely to have TPC {$>$} 90thpercentile.},

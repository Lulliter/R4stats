# SEE https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/variables.html
# If you are using a Quarto project, the `var` shortcode enables you to insert
# content from a project-level _variables.yml file into the _quarto.yml file

# Variables can be either simple values or can include arbitrary markdown content

## --- To include the value of a variable, use:
#	+ the `{{< var >}}` shortcode in normal *.qmd       {{< var websites.lulas_site >}}
#	+ the `"{{< var >}}"` shortcode in YAML entry       "{{< var websites.lulas_site >}}"

### ---- DOESN"T WORK IN YAML (but DOES in footer) -- ðŸ¤¯
# metadata fields such as author, title, etc., in the YAML are treated as static text fields and do not support dynamic variables like {{< >}}.

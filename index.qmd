### Welcome! 

This website hosts some teaching material on **"Introduction to Statistics & Machine Learning with R"** â€” an intensive workshop that includes both Lectures and Practice Sessions to reinforce the concepts learned using {{< fa brands r-project >}} programming.

The course was originally designed for a summer workshop offered to a group of PhD students from various EU universities specializing in life sciences (see [{{< var websites.R4biostats >}}]({{< var websites.R4biostats >}})).
<br> 

I (*Luisa*) co-created that workshop with my sister (*Chiara* ðŸ˜Š) and I am currently revising and expanding the materials.

### Welcome! 

This website hosts the teaching materials for **"Introduction to Statistics & Machine Learning with R"** â€” an intensive workshop that includes both Lectures and Practice Sessions to reinforce the concepts learned using {{< fa brands r-project >}} programming.

This course was originally designed for a summer workshop taught by **Chiara Mimmi** (my sister ðŸ˜Š) to a group of PhD students from various EU universities specializing in life sciences (see [{{< var websites.R4biostats >}}]({{< var websites.R4biostats >}})).   
I, **Luisa Mimmi**, curated the materials for the R Labs and the website, and I am currently revising and expanding these resources.

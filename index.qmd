# Welcome! 

This website collects the materials used for teaching **Introductory Statistics** with R.  

This (ongoing) work collected here originated from the preparation of a Summer workshop in July 2024 that my sister taught to a group of EU PhD students in the life science fields: see [{{< var websites.R4biostats >}}]({{< var websites.R4biostats >}}).

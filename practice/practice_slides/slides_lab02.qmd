::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
For the most part, we will refer to a real clinical dataset (for which a *Creative Commons license* was granted) discussed in two articles (also open access) :  

+ Ahmad, T., Munir, A., Bhatti, S. H., Aftab, M., & Raza, M. A. (2017). ***Survival analysis of heart failure patients: A case study***. PLOS ONE, 12(7), e0181001. [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181001](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181001)

:::

## [Importing from project folder (previously downloaded file)]{.r-fit-text}

You can access the dataset either:  

+ From the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository [Heart Failure Clinical Records](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/519/heart+failure+clinical+records)
+ From the workshop website: use function `here` to specify the complete path of the input data folder

```{r}
# Check my working directory location
# here::here()

# Use `here` in specifying all the subfolders AFTER the working directory 
heart_failure <- read.csv(file = here::here("practice", "data_input", "02_datasets",
                                      "heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv"), 
                          header = TRUE, # 1st line is the name of the variables
                          sep = ",", # which is the field separator character.
                          na.strings = c("?","NA" ), # specific MISSING values  
                          row.names = NULL)

# INSPECTING THE "HEART FAILURE" DATASET

## [What are the variables and their levels of measurement?]{.r-fit-text}

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
The data, with medical records of **299 heart failure patient**, were collected at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and at the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab, Pakistan), during April–December 2015. See @tbl-heart_vars [@chicco_machine_2020, p.3].
:::

![](../../images/HEART_FAIL_vars.png){#tbl-heart_vars} 


## [Look into the dataset just loaded in the R environment]{.r-fit-text}

Recall some `base R` functions from Lab 1

```{r}
# What variables are included in this dataset?
colnames(heart_failure)
# How many observations & variables?
nrow(heart_failure)
# How many rows & columns?
dim(heart_failure)
```

## [Inspect the dataframe structure (`base R`)]{.r-fit-text}

```{r}
# What does the dataframe look like?
str(heart_failure)
```

## [Inspect the dataframe structure (`skimr`)]{.r-fit-text}

Remember the `skimr` function `skim`?

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
 
# some variables 
heart_failure %>% skimr::skim( age, DEATH_EVENT ) 

# the whole dataframe
heart_failure %>% skimr::skim() 
```

<br><br>

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## {{< bi terminal-fill color=rgba(155,103,35,1.00) >}} You try...
Run `skimr::skim()` on your own either on the whole dataset or on any specific variable
:::

+ notice there are no (missing values) `NAs` in any of the variables

## [Recode some variables for later ease of analysis]{.r-fit-text} 

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
I may need some variables coded as `factor` (e.g. categorical variables for plotting), and, while I am at it, I can add clearer labels for the variables' levels. Here, we are:

+ using tidyverse packages `dplyr` and `forcats`
+ adding new (recoded) variables called *"`oldname_f`"* 
:::

```{r}
heart_failure <-heart_failure %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(DEATH_EVENT_f = as.factor(DEATH_EVENT) %>%
                  forcats::fct_recode("died" = "1", "survived" = "0")) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(sex_f = as.factor(sex) %>%
                  forcats::fct_recode("male" = "1", "female" = "0"))

# check 
table(heart_failure$DEATH_EVENT_f)
table(heart_failure$sex_f)
```


## [Some more dummy variables recoded as factor]{.r-fit-text}

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
[Mostly for illustration: it's totally fine (if not preferable) to keep these as binary [0,1] variables]

  + It's worth learning the useful function `dplyr::across`^[This is a bit more [advanced](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/colwise.html), but it will save a lot of typing in some situations...], which allows to iteratively transform several columns at once!
  
:::

```{r}
# Recode as factor with levels "yes" (= 1), "no" (= 0)
fct_cols = c("anaemia", "diabetes", "high_blood_pressure", "smoking" )

heart_failure <- heart_failure  %>% 
  ## ---- 1st create new cols as "factor versions" of old cols
  dplyr::mutate(
    # let's introduce `across` function 
    dplyr::across(
      # Columns to transform
      .cols = all_of(fct_cols), 
      # Functions to apply to each col  
      .fns =  ~as.factor (.x),
      # new name to apply where "{.col}" stands for the selected column
      .names = "{.col}_f")) %>% 
  ## ---- 2nd create new cols as "factor versions" of old cols
  dplyr::mutate(
    dplyr::across(
      # Columns to transform 2 conditions 
      .cols = ends_with("_f") & !matches(c( "DEATH_EVENT_f", "sex_f" )) , 
      # Functions to apply to each col(different syntax)
      .fns = ~forcats::fct_recode(.x,  yes = "1", no = "0" )))
``` 

 
## [(Small digression on `dplyr::across`)]{.r-fit-text}

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
Notice how `dplyr::across(.cols = ..., .fns = ..., .names = ...)` has these arguments:

1. `.cols =` to select the columns which we want to transform (i.e. `fct_cols`)
    + with help from `tidyselect` functions: `all_of`, `ends_with`, and `matches`
2.  `.fns = ~function(.x)` to specify the `function`
            <!-- .fns =  as.factor,  -->
            <!-- .fns =  function (x) as.factor (x),  -->
            <!-- .fns =  ~as.factor (.x), -->
    + where `~function(.x)` uses the "anonymous function" syntax of the `tidyverse`
    + and `.x` inside the function is a "stand in" for *each of the columns selected*
3. [*optional*] `.names =` to name the new cols created using `{.col}` in place of each of the transformed columns
:::


```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "5,12|6,13|8"

## ---- 1st create new cols as "factor versions" of old cols
heart_failure <- heart_failure  %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    dplyr::across(
      .cols = all_of(fct_cols), 
      .fns = ~as.factor (.x), 
      # (optional)
      .names = "{.col}_f")) %>% 
  ## ---- 2nd create new cols as "factor versions" of old cols
  dplyr::mutate(
    dplyr::across(
      .cols = ends_with("_f") & !matches(c( "DEATH_EVENT_f", "sex_f" )) , 
      .fns =  ~forcats::fct_recode(.x,  yes = "1", no = "0" )))
```


# [VISUAL DATA EXPLORATION FOR THE "HEART FAILURE"]{.r-fit-text}

**CONTINUOUS VARIABLES**
 
## Why is visual exploration important?

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
+ Gaining insight on the variables (range, outliers, missing data)
+ Preliminary check of assumptions for parametric hypothesis testing:
  + normally distributed outcome variables?
  + homogeneity of variance across groups? 

Let's explore the **Heart failure dataset** with some data visualization...

+ Following the referenced articles (which were mostly interested in predict mortality based on patients' characteristics), we will take the categorical, binary variable `DEATH_EVENT_f` as our main criterion to split the sample (into *survived* and *dead* patients) to explore any significant difference between groups in terms of means of known quantitative features.   
+ We will look at both:
  + **continuous variables** in the dataset (with the Probability Density Function (PDF))
  + **discrete variables** in the dataset (with the Probability Mass Function (PMF))

# HYPOTHESIS TESTNG - some examples - 

Let's continue to explore data from the **heart failure patients' dataset**, but this time using **hypothesis testing** as we learned in Lecture 2. We will do two types of test:

1. Comparing a sample **against a *hypothetical* general population** 
2. Testing if mean variables' **differences between the two groups of patients** (those who survived after heart failure event and those who didn't) is statistically significant 
 

# --- EXAMPLE A  --- 

**(1 sample | n > 30 |  Z test)**

Stating the above hypotheses more formally:

**What is the population Total Platelet Count (TPC) mean for all people who suffered  of heart failure ($𝝁_{HF}$)?** 

+ $𝑯_𝟎$ : there is no difference in mean TPC between patients who suffered heart failure and the general population  
  + $𝝁_{HF}$ = 236 -> hypothesis of no effect or (“no difference”) 

+ $𝑯_𝒂$ : there is a difference in mean TPC between patients who have suffered heart failure and the general population (“some effect”). This can be formalized as either:
  + $𝝁_{HF}$ < 236 (one-sided test), or

In this case, we have: 

+ a large sample $(n > 100)$
+ a known $𝛔^𝟐$ (of the reference population)
+ the observed sample mean $\bar{x}$ and sample sd $s$. 

So we can compute: 

$𝒁_{calc}=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$

+ ✍🏻 Let's do it "by hand" first to see the steps 
```{r}
# General Population of reference 
mu <- 236 
sigma  <- 59
# Sample of HF patients
n <- 299
x_HF <- mean(heart_failure$plat_norm)         #    263.358
s_HF <- sd(heart_failure$plat_norm)           #    97.80424
# IF large sample & KNOWN pop variance

z_calc_HF <-  (x_HF - mu) / std_err_HF        # 8.018043
```
:::

## [2.b Computation of the p-value associated to the test statistic]{.r-fit-text}  

To find the **p-value** associated with a z-score in R, we can use the `pnorm()` function, which uses the following syntax:

  + `q`: The z-score
  + `mean`: The mean of the normal distribution. Default is 0.
  + `sd`: The standard deviation of the normal distribution. Default is 1.
  + `lower.tail`: 
    + If TRUE, the probability to the left of q in the normal distribution is returned 
    + If FALSE, the probability to the right is returned. Default is TRUE.
```{r}
# Left-tailed test
p_value_l <- stats::pnorm(z_calc_HF, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE) 
# Right-tailed test
p_value_r <- stats::pnorm(z_calc_HF, mean = 0, sd = 1,lower.tail = FALSE) 
# Two-tailed test  (our case)
p_value_two <- 2*stats::pnorm(z_calc_HF, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = FALSE)  
```

## [2.c Computation of the p-value associated to the test statistic]{.r-fit-text}  

+ 👩🏻‍💻 Let's see how this could be done using an R function `BSDA::z.test`
```{r}
z_test_summary <- BSDA::z.test(x = heart_failure$plat_norm,   
             alternative='two.sided', 
             mu=236, 
             sigma.x=59, 
             conf.level=.95)
z_test_summary
```

Same results! 

## 3. Results and interpretation

1.  Based on the critical region, the calculated test statistic `z_calc_HF = 8.0180` falls in the CRITICAL REGION (well beyond the critical point) 

```{r}
# given 
z_critical  <- c(-1.96, +1.96) # (Z score corresponding to 𝛼  = 0.05)
# Check 
z_calc_HF > z_critical 
```

2.  Based on the p-value, `p_value_two = 1.07443e-15` is much much smaller than $\alpha$  

```{r}
# Check
p_value_two <  0.05
```

**DECISION**: we reject the Null Hypothesis (basically we conclude that it is extremely unlikely that the sample we drew could have occurred just by chance). So the test indicates that, indeed, there is a difference between heart failure patients and the general population in terms of average platelets count.

## Comparing sample mean to a hypothesized population mean (with t test)

Same question, but with a *smaller sample* to work on (this varies, but generally it means $n < 30$). Imagine the patients were only observed over a **follow-up period of 21 days**, and also let's assume we don't know the population’s variance

Stating the hypothesis more formally:

**What is the population Total Platelet Count (TPC) mean for all people who suffered  of heart failure ($𝝁_{HF21d}$) in the past 21 days or less?** 

+ $𝑯_𝟎$ : there is no difference in mean TPC between patients who suffered heart failure (visited in 21 days) and the general population  
  + $𝝁_{HF21d}$ = 236 -> hypothesis of no effect or (“no difference”) 

+ $𝑯_𝒂$ : there is a difference in mean TPC between patients who have suffered heart failure and the general population (“some effect”). This can be formalized as:

## 2.a Picking the suitable test   

In this case, we have: 

+ a "small"  sample $n = 23$
+ an unknown $𝛔^𝟐$ (of the reference population)
+ We obtained the sample mean $\bar{x}$ and sample sd $s$.

3. The dependent variable is normally distributed (Platelets Count in 10^3 "/µL") ✅
  + (If not, use *non parametric* test)  
4. The variance within the 2 groups should be similar ❓

A test statistic (F) of 1.02 is obtained, with degrees of freedom 95 and 202. 

The p-value is 0.89, greater than the p-value threshold of 0.05. This suggests **we can not reject the null hypothesis of equal variances**. 

The variance within the 2 groups should be similar ✅  --> we can run a t-test.

+ $standard\, error$ of the means' difference is obtained as **pooled estimate standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the difference**

We will use **‘one- way’ ANOVA**, which serves when there is only one explanatory variable (“treatment”) with 3 or more levels, and only one level of treatment is applied for a given subject. 

For this particular case, we use another realistic dataset showing the survival times of 33 laboratory mice  with thymic leukemia who were randomly divided into 3 groups: 

  + 1st group received Treatment 1
  + 2nd group received Treatment 2
  + 3rd group as Control


```{r}
# load new dataset
mice <- readxl::read_excel(here::here("practice","data_input",
                                      "02_datasets","mice_exe_ANOVA.xlsx"))
```


## [1. Question: Is there a statistically significant difference between the mean values of the k populations? ]{.r-fit-text}

Defining the question formally: 

+ $𝑯_𝟎$ : $𝝁_𝟏 = 𝝁_𝟐 =  𝝁_3$  all 3 population means are equal
+ $𝑯_𝒂$ : at least one of  $(𝝁_𝟏,𝝁_𝟐,𝝁_3)$ is not equal to the other means

  ylab(label = "Survival (# days") + xlab(label = "")
```

## 2. Verify the assumptions for one-way ANOVA

The dependent variable is on a metric scale. In the case of the analysis of variance, the independent variable (factor) has at least three levels. 

Assumptions for the results of a one-way ANOVA to be valid:

1. **Independence of observations** – The observations in each group are independent of each other and the observations within groups were obtained by a random sample. ✅
2. **Normally-distributed response variable** – The values of the dependent variable follow a normal distribution. ❓
3. **Homogeneity of variance** – The variances of the populations that the samples come from are equal. ❓

## [Preliminary check for normality (visual)]{.r-fit-text}

```

## [Preliminary check variance equality ]{.r-fit-text}
::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
3. **Homogeneity of variance** – ✅ 
  + (Besides visual inspection, confirmed  by Levene test for variance equality)

[The null hypothesis **$H_0$ = several groups have the same variance** (possible variance differences occur only by chance, since there are small differences in each sampling)]

```{r}
# Levene test for variance equality
levene <- mice %>%                               # name of the data
  car::leveneTest(surv_days ~ as.factor(group),   # continuous DV ~  group IV
                  data = .,            # pipe the data from above
                  center = mean)       # default is median 
levene
```

No evidence of violations of HOV were found, since the p-value for the Levene test (= 0.8427157) is greater than .05, then the variances are not significantly different from each other (i.e., the homogeneity assumption of the variance is met).

## [3 Computation of ANOVA F-ratio]{.r-fit-text} 

ANOVA in R can be done in several ways.

Since it's quite straightforward, let's do all the steps by hand first. We need to obtain the needed "ingredients" to calculate the F-ratio: 

$$𝑭_{calc}=\frac{Mean\, Square\, Between}{Mean, Square\, Within}=  \frac{MSB}{MSW} = \frac{\frac{SSB}{df1}}{\frac{SSW}{df2}} $$

+ Option 1: Let's compute the ANOVA test "by hand" ✍🏻

# Summary statistics
mice_calc <- mice %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(mean_all = mean(surv_days),
         sd_all = sd (surv_days),
         dfw = 33-3, # df1 = n-k
         dfb = 3-1, # df2 = K−1 
         group_f = as.factor(group)
         ) %>%

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
That was just to show how to build it step-by-step (🤓), but we don't have to! We have alternative R functions that can do ANOVA for us:

+ Option 2: With the `stats::aov` followed by the command `summary` 👩🏻‍💻

```{r}
aov_1 <- stats::aov(surv_days ~ group_f,
                 data = mice_calc)
summary(aov_1) 
```

+ Option 3: With the `stats::oneway.test()` function 👩🏻‍💻

```{r}
aov_2 <- stats::oneway.test(surv_days ~ group_f,
            data = mice_calc,
            # assuming equal variances
            var.equal = TRUE)
aov_2
```
 
:::


## 4. Results and interpretation
 
All 3 options have given the same results, i.e., `F-ratio = 5.652` and a  `p-value = 0.00826`


**DECISION**: Given that the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, so we reject the hypothesis that all means are equal. Therefore, we can conclude that *at least one* group is different than the others in mean number of survival days.


::: {.callout-note}
Have you seen the kind of notation `Pr(>F) 0.00826 **` before (as in the output of the `stats::aov` function)?

# A CLOSER LOOK AT TESTING ASSUMPTIONS 

# --- EXAMPLE E  --- 


## [Testing two groups that are *not* independent]{.r-fit-text}

Let's introduce another toy dataset just for demonstration purposes: imagine a statistics test is administered to the *same* group of 12 students **before and after** attending a workshop 😉. 

```{r}
# toy dataset for paired groups
grades <- data.frame(
  before = c(16, 5, 15, 2, 14, 15, 4, 7, 15, 6, 7, 14),
  after = c(19, 18, 9, 17, 8, 7, 16, 19, 20, 9, 11, 18)
)
```

We may reshape the dataframe into the long form using `tidyr::pivot_longer` (for plotting)
```{r}
# reshape into long form
grades_long <- grades %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(id = row_number()) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = before:after, 
                      names_to = "time", 
                      values_to = "grade") %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(id) %>% 
  # recode time as factor 
  dplyr::mutate(time_f = as_factor(time ))  %>% 
  # reorder time_ levels  
  dplyr::mutate(time_f =  fct_relevel(time_f, "after", after =  1))

In this example, it is clear that the two samples are not independent since the same 12 students took the test before and after the workshop.

Given that the normality assumption is NOT violated (and given the small sample size), we use the **paired t-test**, with the following hypotheses:

+ $𝑯_𝟎$ : mean grades before and after the workshop are equal
+ $𝑯_𝒂$ : mean grades before and after the workshop are different

```


## 3. Results and interpretation

We obtain the test statistic, the p-value and a reminder of the hypothesis tested.

The calculated **t value** is `r t_calc_pair` The **p-value** is `r p_value_pair`. Therefore, at the 5% significance level, **we do not reject the null hypothesis** that the statistics' grades are similar before and after the workshop (😭).


## Bonus function! 

It is worth mentioning the `ggstatsplot` package, which combines plots representing the distribution for each group—and the results of the statistical test displayed in the subtitle of the plot. 

Below we check out the `ggwithinstats()` function for *paired samples.*

## Testing samples *without* normality assumption

Let’s go back to the HEART FAILURE dataset but looking at the levels of **Creatinine Phosphokinase (CPK)** in the blood, an enzyme that might indicate a heart failure or injury


## [1. Question: Is there a statistically significant difference between CPK levels in the blood of the survivors v. those who died after heart failure?]{.r-fit-text}

The **Wilcoxon Rank Sum test** is considered to be the nonparametric equivalent to the **two-sample independent t-test**

Its ASSUMPTIONS are:

+ Ordinal or Continuous dependent variable: e.g. CPK levels ✅
+ Independence: All of the observations from both groups are independent of each other ✅
+ Shape: The shapes of the distributions for the two groups are roughly the same ✅

```{r}
wrs_res <- wilcox.test(creatinine_phosphokinase ~ DEATH_EVENT, # immagino 0, 1
                   data = heart_failure ,

                   alternative = "two.sided" )

The **Wilcoxon Rank Sum test** is equivalent to the **Mann-Whitney U test** to compare two independent samples. Different software use one or the other.

## [4. Results and interpretation]{.r-fit-text}

RESULTS: since the test statistic is `W = 9460` and the corresponding `p-value is 0.684 > 0.05`, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

INTERPRETATION: We do not have sufficient evidence to say that CPK levels for dead patients is different than that of survived patients $𝝁_{CPK-died} ≠ 𝝁_{CPK-surv}$ at some statistically significant level)

# --- EXAMPLE G  ---

:::

## [Preliminary check “HOV” assumption (test)]{.r-fit-text}

It is always best to use an actual test, so we use also the **Fisher's F test** to verify equal variances of Serum Sodium concentration in the two groups. [In this test **$H_0$ = “the ratio of variances is equal to 1”**] 

```{r}
f_test_res <- stats::var.test(heart_failure$serum_sodium[heart_failure$DEATH_EVENT == 1] ,
                              heart_failure$serum_sodium[heart_failure$DEATH_EVENT == 0])
f_test_res
```

Given the `p-value = 0.007646` (smaller than $\alpha$) we reject the null hypothesis, hence the HOV assumption for the t test does not hold. 


## [2 Computation of the t test with the Welch correction]{.r-fit-text} 

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
We can still run the **t test but with Welch correction**, i.e. the unequal variance condition is compensated by lowering the df. In fact the documentation (`?t.test`), reads:

  + If `var.equal = TRUE`, then the pooled variance is used to estimate the variance
  + Otherwise (`var.equal = FALSE`), the Welch  approximation to the degrees of freedom is used.

```{r}
# With Welch correction (on by default) Unequal variance is compensated by lowering df
t_test_w <- t.test(heart_failure$serum_sodium[heart_failure$DEATH_EVENT == 1], 
                   heart_failure$serum_sodium[heart_failure$DEATH_EVENT == 0],
                   # here we specify the situation
                   var.equal = FALSE,
                   paired = FALSE, alternative = "two.sided") 

t_test_w
```

:::

## [3. Results and interpretation]{.r-fit-text}


RESULTS: since the test statistic is `t = -3.1645 (with df = 154.01)` and the corresponding `p-value is 0.001872 < 0.05`, we reject the null hypothesis.

INTERPRETATION: We therefore have sufficient evidence to say that the level of serum sodium levels for dead patients is significantly different than that of survived patients $𝝁_{sersod-died} ≠ 𝝁_{sersod-surv}$  


## Final thoughts/recommendations

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}

+ There are often **many ways to do the same thing in R** (which is both a blessing and a curse in open source software). *Which should you choose?* It depends on the situation, but you may want to consider:

  + how recent/popular/well maintained is a `{package}` (this affects its stability) 
  + the more a function abstracts away complexity, the easier it is to use interactively, but the harder it gets to handle inside your own custom functions
  + different function outputs may be more/less suitable for your analysis/publication requirements (check out your peers' choices!)
  + *(Always **read the documentation** to assess all of the above)* 

+ With easy equations, breaking them down "by hand" (at least once!) can really help you understand them

+ It may seem a lot of work to write R code the first time 🥵 (e.g. for a publication-ready plot), but the good news is **once you wrote a script, you will be able to easily re-use it in many more instances** 🙌🏻 😃 

+ **Sample size `n` has a very powerful impact** on classical hypothesis testing results! More on this later...

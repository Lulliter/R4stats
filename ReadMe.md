# Intro to Statistics with R

This website [https://r4statistics.com/](https://r4statistics.com/) hosts some teaching material on **‚ÄúIntroduction to Statistics & Machine Learning with R‚Äù** ‚Äî an intensive workshop that includes both Lectures and Practice Sessions to teach & consolidate the concepts learned using programming. 

+ Originally designed for a summer workshop offered in July of 2024 to a group of PhD students from various EU universities specializing in life sciences ---see [https://R4biostats.com/](https://R4biostats.com/). 


## TO DO

+ ‚úÖ Must do manual 
  + ~~\*.PPTX 2 \*.PDF LOOSES THE EQUATIONS!!!!!~~

+ ‚úÖ  ultimare `practice/practice_slides/slides_lab05.qmd` + practice/RCODE 5 
  + ~~aggiungere decision trees??? NO (dopo!)~~
  + ~~K-MEANS CLUSTERING ? NO (dopo!)~~
  + ~~logistic multiple variables ? NO (too much!)~~

+ Ô∏èüî≥ rivedere `practice/practice_slides/slides_lab06.qmd` &&&  verificare file `practice/Rcode/lab06_code.R`
  +Ô∏è üñçÔ∏èüñçÔ∏èOKKIO che ho fatto nuova funzione che pass da slide a R code `R_resources/extract_r_code.sh`

+ Ô∏èüî≥ `practice/practice_slides/slides_lab05.qmd`-->> standalone lesson on logistic regression for my website

+ Ô∏èüî≥ ripulire un po' di cose extra (lez e labs)

### Extra TO DO

+ Ô∏è‚óΩ **[add `renv`]** bc this is going to last 
+ Ô∏è‚óΩ turn re-usable practice slides code into `tidyeval` functions (plot etc) to be able to replace with different datasets 

## How this website was built

This is a static website built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), shared on a Github [repo](https://github.com/Lulliter/R4biostats) and served via [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) ~~rendered at this link [https://lulliter.github.io/R4stats/](https://lulliter.github.io/R4stats/), or~~ now (after buying a "custom domain") deployed over a custom domain registered with AWS Route 53: [https://r4statistics.com/](https://r4statistics.com/).

The main content of the website pages is contained in *Quarto Markdown* files (`*.qmd`). `*.qmd` files are very similar to regular Markdown (`*.md`) and R Markdown (`*.rmd`) files, except they are designed to be language agnostic.

## Things needed to build the site

1. Install **Quarto** (an open source tool that can be used from RStudio, Jupyter, CLI, etc.)... Most R users will use RStudio
2. Install **git** (distributed version control software)... here some [instructions](https://github.com/git-guides)
3. Create a **Github** account
4. Follow instructions/examples available [here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/)...
5. Font-Awesome Icons downloaded in `./images/*` from [Font-Awsome GH repo /svgs](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/tree/6.x/svgs). To use in:

- `*.md`
  - ~~`![fa-crown](images/copyright-regular.svg)`~~ (no size spec!!!)
  - `<img src="images/copyright-regular.svg" width="16" height="16">` (yes size spec!!!)
- `*.qmd`
  - quarto wrap `{{< fa brands copyright > }}`
  - r inline code `r fontawesome::fa("fab fa-windows", fill = "steelblue")`

6. (An AWS account ...) but only for the custom domain part


# Quirks 
Little things to keep in mind (because semi-automated): 

1. ~~I execute a script `R_resources/slides_fromDrive_2_here.R` from my shell file `___render_deploy.sh` to copy the `*.pptx` files from [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mkits-PaRC8SGnDuMn2h_bKHAVTHXI50?usp=drive_link) to the `./slides/` folder.~~

2. I execute some shell commands (in `./___render_deploy.sh`) to convert `*.pptx` slides to `*.pdf` as soon as they are ~ready...

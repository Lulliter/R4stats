# Intro to Biostatistics with R

This website collects the materials for a 4 day workshop taking place during the MIGEST Summer School in July of 2024

# Quirks 

Little things to keep in mind (because semi-automated) about moving form [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mkits-PaRC8SGnDuMn2h_bKHAVTHXI50?usp=drive_link) (`*.pptx`) lecture files to R lecture files for sharing (`*.pdf`). Before every push to GitHub:

1. I execute a script `R_resources/slides_fromDrive_2_here.R` from my shell file `___render_deploy.sh`
2. I execute the shell commands to convert `*.pptx` slides to `*.pdf` as soon as they are ~ready... 


## TO DO

+ **[CODE refactoring]**
  + ~~add Goggle Analytics~~ 
  + make  `_variable.yml`
    + nome sito 
+ Cancell **parameterize** practicel slides `.qmd`  
    + it doesn't make any sense 
+ turn re-usable practice slides code into `tidyeval` functions (plot etc) to be able to replace with different datasets 

## How this website was built

This is a static website built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), shared on a Github [repo](https://github.com/Lulliter/R4biostats) and served via [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) ~~to be rendered at this link [https://lulliter.github.io/R4biostats/](https://lulliter.github.io/R4biostats/)~~, or (after buying a "custom domain"), now deployed over a custom domain registered with AWS Route 53: <https://r4biostats.com/>.

The main content of the website pages is contained in *Quarto Markdown* files (`*.qmd`). `*.qmd` files are very similar to regular Markdown (`*.md`) and R Markdown (`*.rmd`) files, except they are designed to be language agnostic.

## Things needed to build the site

1. Install **Quarto** (an open source tool that can be used from RStudio, Jupyter, CLI, etc.)... Most R users will use RStudio
2. Install **git** (distributed version control software)... here some [instructions](https://github.com/git-guides)
3. Create a **Github** account
4. Follow instructions/examples available [here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/)...
5. Font-Awsome Icons downloaded in `./images/*` from [Font-Awsome GH repo /svgs](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/tree/6.x/svgs). To use in:

- `*.md`
  - ~~`![fa-crown](images/copyright-regular.svg)`~~ (no size spec!!!)
  - `<img src="images/copyright-regular.svg" width="16" height="16">` (yes size spec!!!)
- `*.qmd`
  - quarto wrap `{{< fa brands copyright > }}`
  - r inline code `r fontawesome::fa("fab fa-windows", fill = "steelblue")`

6. (An AWS account ...) but only for the custom domain part
